# Lighthouse Labs | Ruby on Rails Review

* [X] Rails - How is it so far?
* [ ] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## How is Ruby on Rails going so far for ya'?

* Pretty neat so far!
* Like how quickly we can generate parts of the application!
* More clear to read the code and files
* When it isn't as explicit as other languages, it can be confusing... (convention over configuration!)
* Easy to pass information to/from

## What is Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is a web development library and framework built in/for the Ruby language.

* Emphasis on developer-friendly tools and practices as well as rapid development cycle
* Convention over configuration -> there is a time/place for everything
* ORM - Object Relational Mapper -> ActiveRecord
* Ruby on Rails follows an MVC pattern ("separation of concerns")

Why it is so important?

* Ruby (1995) -> "a general purpose purpose scripting language"
  * A good developer experience
  * Easy to read and write
* Ruby on Rails (2005)
  * Convention and structure to web development
  * Rapid development like this had never been seen before
  * It has now inspired plenty of MVC frameworks and libraries in most/all popular programming languages:
    * Python -> Django
    * PHP -> Laravel
    * C# -> .NET Core MVC Framework
    * JavaScript/NodeJS -> Sails.js / Nest.JS
    * Perl -> Catalyst

### MVC

### We're going to make a quick Ruby on Rails Application Prototype

* We're going to be avoiding `scaffold`
* We will set-up a model with a one-to-many relationship
* We will seed the DB
