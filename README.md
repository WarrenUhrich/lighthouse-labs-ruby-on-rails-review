# Lighthouse Labs | Rails Review

* [ ] Rails - How is it so far?
* [ ] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## Ruby?

* Pretty good; liking it; warming to it!
* Missing JS syntax

## Rails?

* Generate commands super helpful / time-saving
* Controllers allow variables to be available in the views with ease
* A lot of files / convention required to achieve goals!
* Decent / reasonable defaults
* More convenient than Express

## How did this more hands-off unit feel?

* Feels worse at Ruby than JS so far
* Start was challenging, got better
* Rails docs rock!
* Lots of readings, rather dense... lots!!
* Great figuring stuff out on your own!!

## Ruby on Rails

* Ruby is a general purpose interpreted scripting language (1995)
* Ruby on Rails (2005) is a web development framework following MVC
* Inspired other frameworks:
    * Python: Django
    * PHP: Laravel
    * C#: .NET Core MVC Framework
    * Node.js: Sails.js
* MVC?
    * Model: represents data in our app.
    * View: represents our output (often HTML.)
    * Controller: business logic for our app.
* ActiveRecord is an example of an ORM
    * Object Relational Mapper
    * PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite
    * Node.js world: Prisma, Sequelize
* Convention over Configuration
*
