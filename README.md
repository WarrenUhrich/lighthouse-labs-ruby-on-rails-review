## How is Ruby on Rails Goin'?

* Database structure is pretty good (ActiveRecord)
* Have to learn a lot of convention (complexity is abstracted / hidden away)
* Easier to get a lot done faster / at-once
* Taking new languages / frameworks isn't AS hard as one might think... a lot of concepts carry over!

## What is Ruby on Rails?

* Was to provide a powerful and developer-friendly application development framework
* In 2005, Ruby on Rails released and changed the web app development landscape
* Inspired the current greats in all languages:
  * PHP: Laravel
  * Python: Django
  * C#: .NET Core MVC Framework
  * Node.js: Sails.js
* MVC: Model / View / Controller
  * Offers organization / separation of concerns
  * Model: Represents data, database, and data structures.
  * View: Rendering of content / data.
  * Controller: Business logic of our app.. bridges the gap between model and view.
