* [X] Rails - How is it so far?
* [X] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## How is Ruby goin' so far?

* Human-readable is nice!!
* Cool to see different languages do things differently!
* Felt like starting over, was getting comfy with JS and here we are lookin' stuff up again!

## Ruby on Rails?

* Nice to have prescribed structure, less decisions to be made!
* More difficult to find / understand the docs
* Cool to be able to set up parts of project by command / code instead of manually
* ActiveRecord pretty awesome!

## How was the more hands-off nature of the unit?

* Felt "different"
* Lots more Googling
* Jungle directory felt overwhelming at first

## Ruby on Rails

* Ruby is the programming language (1995)
* Ruby on Rails is web development framework (2005)
* MVC framework
    * Model - represents and communicates our data from our database.
    * View - presentation (ERB files.)
    * Controller - actions and behaviours - "business logic" of the application. Glue that sticks models and views together.
* It contains a suite of useful tools for web development including generators and database tools
* ActiveRecord - ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
    * Let's us write Ruby and use our Models instead of writing SQL
* CoC (Convention over Configuration)
    * There's a place and a name for most anything already!
    * Great for team environments, especially!
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

rails new my-rails-project --api --database=mysql
