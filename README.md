## Ruby

How has Ruby been treating you, after having learned JavaScript?

* Confusing! Unfamiliar territory, new syntax!
* OOP - feels familiar after JS

How has Rails been treating you?

* Not yet started! Brand new!

## Ruby on Rails

* Developer-friendly framework for rapid development
* Showed up around ~2005
* MVC framework with CLI tools opened the door for full stack web app development
  * Emphasis on rapid development... a whole CRUD app can be developed in MINUTES
* Inspired other frameworks:
  * Python (Django)
  * PHP (Laravel)
  * C# / .NET Core (.NET Core MVC Framework)
* Convention over configuration
