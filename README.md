# Lighthouse Labs | Rails Review

* [X] How is Rails so far?
* [ ] Ruby on Rails MVC Review
* [ ] Building an Application Prototype

## Things you Like About Rails?

* Simple syntax
* Methods / options available
* Generating files / scaffolding
* MVC pattern!
* Presence of an ORM: ActiveRecord
* Opinionated compared to JS
* Decent documentation (JS has more resources though!)
* Rails is nice for beginners, easy to set-up!
* Very descriptive error messages

## Things you Didn't Like About Rails?

* Unfamiliar syntax (coming from JS, C#, etc.)
* Very OOP-oriented (if you're unfamiliar, this can be difficult)
* Variables can be confusing (PascalCase versus snake_case)
  * Variables / instance variables should be `snake_case`
  * Constants are `ALL_CAPS`
  * Classes and ClassNames should be `PascalCase`
* You must know convention! When to use which type of variable etc.
* Knowing when to use singular versus plural naming!?
* Conventions makes many things implicit, can be hard to track what's coming and going!
* Rendering views can be a bit confusing (convention!!!)
* Front-end is not directly covered by default, this may result in walking away from some convention
* Big mindset shift!
* Slower to refresh than JS

## How was exploring more on-your-own?

* Style and pacing was pretty good! Liked it.
* Fun to learn a second language; many resources out there were better than Compass!
* Interesting to inherit Jungle and update it
