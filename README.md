## How has Ruby been treating ya'?

* Different!
* Easier to learn than maybe we thought it would be...
    * Brain might not like it as much JS!
* Can see how it is useful, not clicking quite as much yet!

## How is Ruby on Rails so far?

* A bit confusing to keep track of things...!
* I like MVC!
* Can be a lot faster to develop with!

## Ruby (1995)

* Developer friendly general-purpose programming language
* Meant to read a lot more like English than many other programming languages

## Ruby on Rails (2005)

* Convention over Configuration
* MVC Model
* A better developer experience (do more with less)
* A rapid development cycle
* ORM - Object Relational Mapper - ActiveRecord
* Other MVC frameworks were inspired by Rails:
    * C# - .NET Core MVC Framework
    * PHP - Laravel
    * Python - Django
