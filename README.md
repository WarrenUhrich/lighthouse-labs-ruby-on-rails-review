# Lighthouse Labs | Rails Review

* [X] Rails - How is it so far?
* [ ] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## How are things goin'? How do you like Rails and this Unit?

* Enjoyin' it! Almost annoying / tedious at the start
* Does a LOT for you!! ActiveRecord vs. pg library is night / day!
* Similar (with no background in Rails) there is a LOT of magicâ€”uncomfortable

## Ruby on Rails

Server-side rapid web application development framework written in Ruby!

* Convention over configuration library.
* DRY principles incorporated
* ORM (Object Relational Mapper) - ActiveRecord

What does Ruby on Rails solve?

* Build apps very very quickly
* Build apps efficiently as a team
* Using the terminal to create consistent DRY code
* It standardized use of MVC in web development

Rails inspired MVC frameworks in every popular language...

* C# - .NET Core MVC Framework
* Python - Django
* Node.js - Sails.js
* PHP - Laravel

## MVC

* Model: manages / represents data and its relationships.
* View: helps us format our client rendered string (HTML/JSON/etc.)
* Controller: the "brain" of our application, business logic lives here. Connects the dots between router, model, and view.
