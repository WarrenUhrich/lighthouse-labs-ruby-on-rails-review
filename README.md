* [X] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## Things ya' Don't Like as Much as JS?

* There's a lot of magic—we don't always get a full say, or see exactly what is happening
* ERB syntax can be a bit to get used to
* Switching syntax can be confusing... @, self, etc.
* Moving from a language like JS, it feels so wrong to ommit parenthesis, curly braces, semi-colons, etc.
* Amount of Ruby monkey patching
* Errors not as easy as JS to understand
* Learning curve—what does each file do?
* Is an OOP approach (a downside if you're used to procedural programming)

## Things ya' Love about Ruby, and Ruby on Rails!

* Easy set-up!
* Generators!
* DB queries pretty easy with ActiveRecord!
* Very easy to use migrations, rollbacks, seeds, etc.

## How was Exploring the Ruby and Ruby on Rails Unit more Independently?

* Fun! Great to have a ticket and have to fix it!
* Not too bad, it comes down to figurin' out the WHY, if we haven't covered it!
* More lost than usual
* Glad there was access to mentors!
* Hard sometimes, but rewarding when you get to the solution!

## Ruby on Rails Inspired!

Now almost every language has a big easy-to-use MVC framework.

* Node.js - Sails.js
* Python - Django
* C# - .NET Core MVC
* PHP - Laravel
