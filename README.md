* [ ] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## How are we feeling about Ruby so far? ( How did you feel about NodeJS? )

* Feels good so far! Sometimes syntax gets ya' though!
* Adjusting to different scoping / syntax! But fun!

## How are we feeling about Ruby on Rails so far? ( How did you feel about Express? )

* No big opinion so far, but so far okay!
* MVC is pretty neat!
* ActiveRecord is really nice!

## Ruby on Rails

* Server-side, web application rapid development framework
* Ruby's goals (1995) were to make pleasant easy-to-read/easy-to-write programming language for general-purpose use
* Custom C applications, or PHP -> circa 1994
* 2005 -> Ruby on Rails entered the scene
  * Ruby on Rails enabled developers to make full DB-enabled apps with FULL CRUD and full-stack in 5-15 minutes
  * Just like Ruby it had a focus on making developers happy, making the developer's life easier, even making teamwork
* In recent years we've seen Ruby on Rails' growth plateau
* Instead of learning Ruby, if you already know another language:
  * Python -> Django
  * Perl -> Catlyst
  * PHP -> Laravel
  * NodeJS -> Sails.js / Nest.JS
* ActiveRecord -> ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
  * SQLite -> file-based DBMS
  * PostgreSQL
  * MariaDB
* Convention over Configuration
  * "Rails"
  * There is a time and place for everything
* MVC
