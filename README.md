# Lighthouse Labs | Rails Review

* [X] Rails - How is it so far?
* [X] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an Application Prototype

## How has Learning Ruby and Rails been Going?

### Positives?

* Seeing the Ruby (on Rails) Magic!
* Generators are nice!!
* No need for semi-colons, curly braces, etc.
* Rails simplifies access to the DB
* Great logging! We know which controller action is in-use
    * Error messaging is very descriptive

### Negatives / Struggles?

* Use of colons can be confusing
* Forces us to understand / use OOP / Classes
* Use of the @ symbol
* Learning conventions... ex) @products rendering _product partial! Magic!
* Understanding the difference between class and instance variables / methods

### Self-Directed Learning?

* Took some time to understand
* Following Compass was a help
* Documentation on Rails was pretty good

## MVC - Model / View / Controller

MVC's goal is "separate concerns." We want each part of our code to be organized - easy to find/edit.

* Model: represent and interact with our data.
* Controller: "brain" of the app - "business logic" what should we do?
* View: the HTML, XML, JSON, etc. sent to the client (often using a templating engine like ERB.)

## Ruby on Rails

* **Ruby** -> Developer Friendly Scripting / Programming Language
* **Ruby on Rails** -> MVC Framework Built in Ruby

### Ruby on Rails...

* Developer friendly
* Easy to read
* Convention over Configuration
* Don't Repeat Yourself
* Object Relational Mapper (ActiveRecord)
* Set the tone for MVC frameworks on the web, inspiring:
    * Python... Django
    * Node.js... Sails.js
    * Perl... Catalyst
    * PHP... Laravel
