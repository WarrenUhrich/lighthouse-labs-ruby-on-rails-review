## How has Ruby been goin' so far?

Compared to JS, how has the learning journey been?

* Like JS more.. have spent more time with it!
* This unit has been difficult but positive!
* Concepts carry over from JS!

## Rails

In JS we had used Express, how has picking up Rails been?

* Has more magic going on under the hood!

## Ruby on Rails

* Server-side, rapid, web application development framework
* Convention over configuration
* ORM - Object Relational Mapper - ActiveRecord
* It follows the MVC design pattern
  * Model: DB - Classes representing DB entities in our code
  * View: ~~"like JSX"~~ Like EJS in our Express - these are our HTML output templates. We use ERB (embedded Ruby.)
  * Controller: "routes" - what happens in different pages/places. Business logic of the web app.
  * Separation of Concerns
* Written in Ruby
* Inspired many rapid development MVC frameworks
  * Django (Python)
  * Catalyst (Perl)
  * Laravel (PHP)
  * Sails.js (JS)
