* Server-side scripting library aimed at rapid app development
* Written in Ruby
* MVC
* Convention over Configuration
* DRY (avoid repeating yourself in code)
* ORM (ActiveRecord)
* Inspired a generation of MVC frameworks!
    * Python now has Django
    * Perl now has Catalyst
    * PHP now has Laravel
    * Node.js now has Sails.js

## Model View Controller

* Model: Represents data.
* Views: Visual representation prepared by the controller.
