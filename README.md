* [X] Rails - How is it so far?
* [X] MVC Review
* [ ] Building an App Prototype

## How has Ruby been goin' so far?

* Like the language, it is different!
* Tempting to program as JS, and try to get it to fit into Ruby
* Difficult to shed old habits and instincts
* ðŸ‘Ž
* Feels like "old technology", not motivating if we might not use it
* What if we learned TypeScript or Python?
* What if Java, or C, was a better option?

## How has Rails been so far?

* Likes the ERB syntax is very much like EJS
* More time on Express, feels more comfortable
* Learning MVC on top of a new language and framework is difficult
* ActiveRecord is super useful and convenient
  * ORM - Object Relational Mapper
  * ---> NodeJS has ORMs too, like Prisma, Sequelize

## Ruby on Rails

* 2005 -> MVC web framework
* Meant to be developer-friendly
  * Mature and powerful command-line tools
  * Rapid-development
* Convention over configuration
* Other languages began coming out with their own MVC rapid-development frameworks...
  * C# - .NET Core MVC Framework
  * PHP - Laravel
  * Python - Django
  * NodeJS - Sails.js
